# Weather Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Weather Dashboard is a responsive single-page application (SPA) that allows users to search for current weather information by city name. The application dynamically fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in an attractive, user-friendly interface

## Features
- üå§Ô∏è **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Changes based on weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy).
- üìä **Weather Details**: Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions in visually distinct sections.
- üåç **Previously Searched Cities**: Stores and displays the last searched cities using browser-side storage.
- üîÑ **Real-Time Weather Updates**: Fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- üñºÔ∏è **Animated Icons**: Weather conditions are represented with visually appealing animated SVGs or Lottie animations.
- üíæ **Local Storage Integration**: Retains previously searched cities for future reference.
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manenikita31/weather-dashboard.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd weather-dashboard
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
4. Add an .env file at the root level with your OpenWeatherMap API key:
   ```bash
   API_KEY=openweathermap_api_key
5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   node server.js
6. Open your browser and navigate to:
   http://localhost:3000

## API Documentation
### Weather Data API
The application integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather details.

#### Endpoint

 GET /weather?city={city-name}

#### Parameters:
1. city = City name (ex. London)
2. appid = OpenWeatherMap API key

## Design Decisions
1. Dynamic Backgrounds: Background images change based on weather conditions for an immersive user experience.
2. User-Friendly Storage: Browser-side storage ensures that users can revisit their previously searched cities.
3. Modern Aesthetics: Gradient backgrounds that adapt to weather conditions.
4. Performance: API calls are cached locally for frequently searched cities. Lightweight animations ensure smooth performance

## Future Improvements
1. 5-Day Weather Forecast:
   - Extend functionality to display a 5-day forecast for the selected city.
2. Localization:
   - Support for multiple languages.
3. Improved Animations:
   - Use advanced Lottie animations for weather icons.
4. Dark Mode:
   - Add support for a dark mode theme.
5. Search Suggestions:
   - Auto-suggest cities while typing in the search bar.
6. User Authentication:
   - Allow users to save favorite cities with personalized dashboards.

## Notes About Platform Limitations
1. API Rate Limits:
- The free tier of the OpenWeatherMap API allows only a limited number of calls per minute. Ensure caching and limit requests to avoid hitting the cap.

2. Cold Starts (Replit Deployment):
- If deployed on Replit, the backend server may experience delays when waking up after inactivity.

3. Browser Storage Limits:
- localStorage has a storage limit of 5MB, which should suffice for storing a list of previously searched cities
